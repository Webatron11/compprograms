Using your knowledge of Python from the section above, try and solve some of these questions as one-liners.

EASY
1. Print the first ten multiples of two (2, 4, 8, 16...) separated by spaces
CHALLENGE: See how many unique (not just changing syntax) ways you can do this problem

MEDIUM
2. Return an array of the first twenty fibonacci numbers starting with “1, 1” (an array named x with [1, 1] is defined for you)
CHALLENGE: Try and complete this question without the use of x, returning the array at the end (This one is very hard and requires the use of a special operator)

HARD
3. Write a function or lambda to return the amount of unique characters in a string of only lowercase letters (“aaaaa” returns 1, “abcde” returns 5, “aabbabbabab” returns 2)
4. Write a function or lambda to check if a string is a palindrome (“racecar” reversed is “racecar”, which is a palindrome) (make sure to account for strings with odd and even letter counts)
5. Write a function which swaps the case of a string (“Among Us” = “aMONG uS”, “Cool. String” = “cOOL. sTRING”)
